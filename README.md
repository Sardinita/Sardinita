Actually I'm Software Engineering student and I'm Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador
  
The main area of programming that I like is the development of artificial intelligence and video games, I find it very interesting how these two branches are in our daily life, many times we even use artificial intelligence without realizing it.

 I'm currently self-studying cloud computing using Microsoft Azure and starting to study the python programming language.

I really like to share with others what I learn and about opportunities for students that different platforms provide.
